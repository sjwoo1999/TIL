<h2>2.1 Types of Cloud Computing</h2>

- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
    - Cloud computing has various forms like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a model in which computing resources, such as CPUs and hardware, are delivered as a service over a network.
    - Typical IaaS services include virtual servers and online storage.
    - A virtual server is a software division of a physical server's CPU, memory, storage, and other hardware resources owned by a cloud provider.
    - Instead of purchasing a physical server, business users can create as many virtual servers as they need, when they need them.
    - You can also create a virtual server(PC) in just a few minutes.
    - Once created, virtual server resources can be freely scaled up and down as needed. Virtual servers are free to run software such as databases, middleware, and applications that are installed on the OS, but business users must install and manage them themselves.
    - As for the pricing system of IaaS, many cloud services adopt a pay-as-you-go or monthly flat fee based on usage.
    - In addition, you may be charged based on the amount of data transferred by uploading and downloading data(depending on the cloud provider, data transfer may be free).
- Example of IaaS
    - An example of a use case for IaaS is a server for a website.
    - If you're running a website and you launch a web page for a promotional event, you might get a lot of traffic in a short period of time.
    - Therefore, by flexibly changing the amount of resources, such as temporarily borrowing and using a large amount of computing resources only during the promotion, and reducing the amount of resources when the promotion ends, you can reduce the construction cost and operation cost of a stable website.
    - IaaS is also being adopted for major system bases such as timekeeping systems for corporate users. For example, enterprise resource planning(ERP) systems, which are business integration packages for companies, are now being operated on IaaS.
- Representative IaaS services
    - Representative IaaS services include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provided by Amazon Web Services.
- Advantages and disadvantages of IaaS
    - Advantages
        - the most flexible cloud service models
        - a physical server (X)
        - just pay for the necessary resources
        - owners can scale or downsize
        - automate the distribution of storage, servers, networking, and processing power.
    - Disadvantages
        - security risks
        - tolearn the way of handling the infrastructure efficiently.
    - depending on the internet connection
- What is Paas?
    - Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a model that provides an enterprise's application execution environment and application development environment as a service.
    - It is time-consuming for enterprise users to build their own application development environments from scratch.
    - In this regard, PaaS provides pre-built application execution environments and databases that support programming languages such as Java, PHP, and Ruby
    - Therefore, you can use that base without having to build and maintain infrastructure, so you can develop applications and provide services in a short period of time.
- Difference between IaaS and Paas
    - The difference between PaaS and IaaS is that the server, network, and security parts are delegated to the cloud provider, making it easier to build and operate.
    - While both are integral components of the cloud ecosystem, they serve different purposes and cater to varied needs.
    - IaaS focuses on providing virtualized computing resources over the internet.
    - PaaS offers a platform where you can swiftly deploy and run your applications, without the need for intricate configurations.
- Features of PaaS
    - The main uses of PaaS are when you need a lot processing power for development and testing, or to offload peak loads of your own applications.
    - It is also suitable for mobile services such as smartphones and tablets that require internet access.
    - In addition, it is attracting attention as a platform for efficiently collecting and processing large amounts of data such as sensor data generated by various devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), where various "things" communicate with each otehr over the internet.
- Example of PaaS
    - Representative PaaS services and software include Force.com from Salesforce, kintone from Cyborg, and Cloud Foundry, and open source PaaS-based software.
- Advantages and disadvantages of PaaS
    - Advantages
        - very much affordable

        - Difficult optimization
        - compatibility issues
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - What is the SaaS?
        - SaaS refers to the provision of software functions, primarily those used in business, as a service over a network, such as the Internet, on an as-needed basis.
        - It provides a multi-tenant service that is based on sharing a single server with multiple companies.
        - However, data is designed to be seperated by corporate users to ensure security.
        - Updating the software is done by the cloud provider, not by the enterprise user, so you always have the latest features available, and bugs in the software are not left unattended.
        - In the case of SaaS, you contract for the service, and as soon as your user account is ready, you can start using the service.
        - Compared to purchasing packaged software, the lead time to adoption can be significantly reduced.
    - Logic of SaaS
        - Application logic runs in the Cloud
        - Users can access SaaS applications on any device
    - Representative software by SaaS
        - Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
