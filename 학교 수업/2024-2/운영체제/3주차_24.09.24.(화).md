<h3>Objectives</h3>

- Understand the services an operating system provides to users, processes, and other systems.
- Explore the various ways operating systems can be structured.

<h3>Operating System Services</h3>

- Operating systems provide essential services by interacting with hardware components such as the CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices.

<h3>Services Helpful to Users</h3>

- User Interface (UI)
    - Command-Line Interface (CLI): Text-based interface allowing direct command entry.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): Visual interface with icons and windows for user interaction.
    - Batch Interface: Executes commands from a file without user interaction (less common today).
- Program Execution
    - Loading programs into memory.
    - Running programs.
    - Handling program termination (normal or abnormal).
- I/O Operations
    - Managing input/output devices.
    - Facilitating I/O for running programs.
- File-System Manipulation
    - Reading and writing files and directories.
    - Creating and deleting files.
	- Searching and listing files.
	- Managing file permissions.
- Communications
	- Exchanging information between processes, either on the same computer or over a network.
	- Utilizing shared memory or message passing mechanisms.
- Error Detection
	•	Detecting errors in hardware components and user programs.
	•	Providing debugging facilities.

<h3>Services for System Efficiency</h3>

- Resource Allocation
    - Managing and allocating resources like CPU cycles, main memory, and I/O devices to multiple users or jobs running concurrently.
- Accounting
    - Tracking resource usage by users for billing or statistical purposes.
- Protection and Security
    - Controlling access to system resources.
	- Ensuring that processes do not interfere with each other.
	- Authenticating users and defending against external attacks.

<h3>User Operating System Interface</h3>

- Users interact with the operating system through interfaces that provide access to system services.

<h3>Command-Line Interface (CLI)</h3>

- Allows users to type commands directly to the system.
- Examples include Bash, CSH, KSH on Unix/Linux systems, and CMD on Windows.

<h3>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>

- Provides a visual environment with windows, icons, and menus.
- Examples include Windows GUI, macOS Aqua, and desktop environments like GNOME or KDE on Linux.

<h3>System Calls</h3>

- System calls are the programming interface to the services provided by the operating system.

    - Typically written in high-level languages like C or C++.
    - Accessed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) rather than direct system call use.

<h3>APIs and Their Importance</h3>

- Common APIs:
- Win32/Win64 API: For Windows systems.
- POSIX API: For POSIX-compliant systems like Unix, Linux, and macOS.
- Java API: For the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Reasons to Use APIs:
- Simplify system call usage.
- Hide complex implementation details.
- Provide portability across different hardware systems.

<h3>System Call Implementation</h3>

- Each system call has a specific number and is maintained in a system call table.
- The system call interface invokes the intended system call in the OS kernel.
- The caller uses the API and does not need to know the implementation details.

<h3>Parameter Passing Methods</h3>

- Registers: Parameters passed directly in CPU registers.
- Block/Table: Parameters stored in a memory block; the address is passed in a register.
- Stack: Parameters pushed onto the stack by the program and popped off by the operating system.

<h3>Types of System Calls</h3>

- Process Control
    - Create and terminate processes.
    - Load and execute programs.
    - Get and set process attributes.
- File Management
    - Create and delete files.
    - Open and close files.
    - Read, write, and reposition files.
- Device Management
    - Request and release devices.
    - Read and write devices.
    - Get and set device attributes.
- Information Maintenance
    - Get and set system data (time, date).
	- Get and set process, file, or device attributes.
- Communications
	- Create and delete communication connections.
	- Send and receive messages.
	- Transfer status information.

<h3>System Programs</h3>

- System programs provide a convenient environment for program development and execution.

	- File Manipulation: Tools to create, delete, copy, rename, and manage files and directories.
	- Status Information: Programs to obtain system info like date, time, memory usage.
	- File Modification: Text editors and utilities to modify files.
	- Programming Language Support: Compilers, assemblers, debuggers, and interpreters.
	- Program Loading and Execution: Loaders and linkers to prepare programs for execution.
	- Communications: Utilities to send messages, browse web pages, and transfer files.

<h3>Operating System Design and Implementation</h3>

- Designing an operating system involves balancing various goals and making strategic choices.

<h3>Design Goals</h3>
	- User Goals: The OS should be convenient, easy to use, reliable, safe, and fast.
	- System Goals: The OS should be easy to design, implement, and maintain, as well as flexible, reliable, error-free, and efficient.

<h3>Policy vs. Mechanism</h3>
	- Policy: Defines what will be done.
	- Mechanism: Defines how to do it.
	- Separating policy from mechanism allows flexibility and easier modification.

<h3>Operating System Structure</h3>

- Operating systems can be structured in various ways to improve functionality and maintainability.

<h3>Simple Structure</h3>
	- Minimal separation between system components.
	- Example: MS-DOS, which has limited modularity and direct access to hardware.

<h3>Layered Structure</h3>
	- Divides the OS into layers, each built upon lower layers.
	- Each layer interacts only with the layer below it.
	- Simplifies debugging and system verification.

<h3>Microkernel Structure</h3>
	- Moves as much functionality as possible from the kernel into user space.
	- Communication between user modules occurs via message passing.
	- Example: Mach OS.

<h3>Modular Kernel Structure</h3>
    - Uses a core kernel with dynamically loadable modules.
	- Modules communicate over known interfaces.
	- Combines benefits of layered and microkernel structures.
	- Example: Modern operating systems like Linux.

<h3>Virtual Machines</h3>

- A virtual machine (VM) emulates a complete hardware system, allowing multiple OS instances on a single physical machine.

	- Provides an interface identical to the underlying hardware.
	- Each VM is isolated from others, ensuring resource protection.

<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>

- Advantages:
	- Complete resource isolation and protection.
	- Ideal for OS development and testing.
- Disadvantages:
	- Implementation complexity.
	- Performance overhead due to virtualization.
