<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is an Operating System?</h3>

- A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.
    - HW와 사용자의 중간자 역할을 함.

- Operating system goals:
    - Process management
    - Resource management
        - Storage
        - Memory
        - I/O
    - Environment management

<h3>Computer System Structure</h3>

- Hardware
    - CPU, memory, I/O devices
- Operating system
- Application programs
    - Word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, ...
- Users

<h3>Operating System Definition</h3>

- OS is a resource allocator
    - manages all resources
    - decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
- OS is a control program
    - controls execution of programs to prevent erros and improper use of the computer
- No universally accepted definition
- varies wildly
- "The one program running at all times on the computer" is the "kernel". (System program/application program)

<h3>Computer Startup</h3>

- Bootstrap program is loaded at power-up or reboot
- Typically stored in ROM or EEPROM generally known as firmware.
- initialize all aspects of system: system diagnostics
- loads operating system kernel into memory and starts execution
    - Sometimes, execute boot block code, the boot block loads OS and execute.
- From now on, computer is under control of OS kernel.

<br>

- Operating System
    - executes the first process, such as "init"
    - waits for some event to occur.

<h3>Computer System Organization</h3>

- Computer-system hardware components
    - One or more CPUs, device controllers connected through common bus providing access to shared memory
    - Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles
- Controller : 데이터 전송 준비가 되면, interrupt 발생.
- CPU에게 내가 메모리로부터 데이터 전송을 할 준비가 되어있다라는 것을 알려주고,
<br/>
그 interrupt를 통해서 Controller가 데이터 전송의 허가를 받고 데이터 전송을 진행하게 되는 것..
- CPU와 Controller는 메모리에 데이터의 저장을 서로 경쟁을 하며 동작을 한다.
    - 동일한 Bus를 공유하며 사용한다.
        - CPU와 Controller가 동시에 사용하면 충돌이 발생할 수 있음.
        - 이런 충돌 해결법 : interrupt

<h3>North and South bridge</h3>

- North bridge
    - North bridge MCH(Memory Controller Hub)는 메모리 인터페이스와 그래픽 카드 인터페이스를 관리한다.
- South bridge
    - South bridge ICH(I/O Controller Hub)는 슬롯(Slot)-ISA, ELSA, PCI과 HDD, USB, PS2 등을 컨트롤한다.

<h3>Computer System Operations | 중간 요약!</h3>

- I/O devices and the CPU can execute concurrently.
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type.
- Each device controller has a local buffer. ⭐️
- CPU moves data from/to main memory to/from local buffers.
- I/O is a data transfer from the device to local buffer of controller.
- Device controller informs CPU that it has finished its operation by causing an interrupt.

<h3>Interrupt</h3>

- The occurrence of an event is usually signaled by an interrupt from either the hardware and the software.
    - Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending signal to the CPU (device controller, timer)
    - Software may trigger an interrupt by executing a special operation called a system call
    - HW/SW가 발생시킨 interrupt는 CPU에게 전송이 됨.
<br/>

- When the CPU is interrupted
    - stops what it is doing
    - immediately transfers execution to a fixed location
    - the fixed location usually contains the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located
    - executes the interrupt service routine
    - resumes the interrupted computation on completion.

<h3>Common Functions of Interrupt</h3>

- Intterupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the address of all the interrupt service routines.
    - 다양한 종류의 interrupt가 정의되어 있고, 각 interrupt 종류마다 실행되어야 하는 코드가 다르다.
    - C 프로그램을 할 때 정의한 function과 같은 것이라 생각하면 된다.
- Interrupt architecture must save the address of the interrupted instruction.
    - by storing registers and the program counter.
    - 멈췄다가 다시 실행하기 위해서 주소를 저장해둔다.
    - registers와 program counter에 대한 정보.
- Incoming interrupts are disabled while another interrupt is being processed to prevent a lost interrupt.
    - Interrupt가 발생했을 땐 다른 Interrupt가 발생할 수 없음.
- A trap is a software-genertaed interrupt caused either by an error or a user request.
    - trap : system call로 발생하는 software interrupt
- An operating system is interrupt driven.

<h3>Interrupt Service Routine</h3>

- Interrupt가 발생했을 때 실행되는 코드

- Generic routine
    - Interrupt Service Routine, Interrupt-Specific handler를 찾아가기 위해 만 먼저 방문하고
    - Interrupt Number에 따라서 해당되는 서비스 루틴이 어디에 있는지를 저장해뒀다가 해당되는 코드를 수행하게 된다.
- interrupt service routine (interrupt-specific handler)

- invoke a generic routine to examine the interrupt information
- call the interrupt-specific handler.

- Interrupts must be handled quickly.
    - Only predefined number of interrupts are possible
    - A table of pointers to interrupt handler is used
        - Interrupt vector table
            - 서비스 루틴들이 어디에 있는지를 저장해두는 테이블
    - The table of pointers is sorted in low memory location.
